# TensorflowJS_course
My projects and assignments for the tensorflow JS course on coursera. You can find the course here - https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow/

Most of this code is for the assignments that were a part of this course, but some of it is code I wanted to experiment with during the course.
